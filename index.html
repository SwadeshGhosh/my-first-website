                I used to think that you were either a web designer or a web developer. Or maybe you were one of those rare unicorns who did both. But either way, you either worked on the design of the site, or the code that made it work. And then I started seeing all these job listings asking for “front end developers” or “back end developers” and even “full stack developers.” Um. What the heck is a full stack developer?

            <p>The corporate world can be very daunting or very demanding, especially when you are a fresher. From a comparatively plain sailing journey of a college/university life to a highly competitive working environment, the transition is never easy. Yet I can tell you that getting into the battleground is damn exciting. You get to learn technologies that you might have never heard of, learn stuff from the elites out there and the best of all; you feel important because your code and your effort matters to the company.</p>
